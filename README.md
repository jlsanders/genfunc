Code developed for [Sanders & Binney (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3600)

This code is designed to estimate actions, angles and frequencies from an orbit
time series. Full details are given in Sanders & Binney (2014) but here is a brief
overview. The code takes a series of phase-space points (x_i,v_i), and finds the
angle-action coordinates in the best-fitting toy potential. If the orbit is a loop
this toy potential is the isochrone, whilst if it is a box it is the triaxial harmonic
oscillator. The true angle-actions are related to these toy variables via a generating
function. The Fourier components of the generating function can be solved for by solving
the equations generated by each time sample.

The main routine is find_actions() in genfunc_3d.py. This takes a series of phase-space points,
finds the toy angle-actions (toy_potentials.py) and then solves the equations (solver.py).

In genfunc_3d.py there are test cases which are investigated in the paper. These rely on
finding the true actions and frequencies in a triaxial St\"ackel potential. The code for
doing this is in new_struct and requires the [Gnu Science Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
and [boost python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/python/doc/). The code for estimating
the actions and frequencies does not rely on this code -- it is purely for test purposes.
